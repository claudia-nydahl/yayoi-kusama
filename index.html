					<h1>Early Life</h1>
				</div>
				<p>Kusama’s love for pattern and repetition may stem from an unhappy childhood, where she already started to use painting as a method to ward off anxieties. She was born in 1929, to a conservative family who owned a seed farm and she was put to work planting crops. Here, her fascination for pumkins grew. Her family discouraged her painting and wanted her to follow the traditional Japanese way of living. She was completely against this idea and continued to paint day and night, until she was eventually forced to leave home.</p>

					<h1>Early Work</h1>
				</div>
				<p>When Kusama left home in the 1950s, she pursued her dream of moving to New York, the centre of the art world, to become an artist.. She considered New York to be the land of the free. It gave her the freedom to create any kind of work that she wanted - such as surrealism, pop, installation and performance.</p>

					<h1>Net Paintings</h1>
				</div>
				<p>Kusama is well known for her net paintings, which she describes as the net seperating her from the rest of the world. When painting, she first goes into a momentary trance. Then, with complete confidence and without planning, she begins her creations until she completely fills the canvas.</p>

					<h1>Infinity Rooms</h1>
				</div>
				<p>Kusama is most famous for her infinity rooms, which she displays in exhibitions all around the world. These rooms are said to be a portrayal of her inner thoughts, her feelings, from what she sees and from her fears. She invites you into her world and allows the audience to take pictures and post them on the internet and via social media. By sharing and letting people share the exhibition, Kusama is spreading her word into infinity.</p>
